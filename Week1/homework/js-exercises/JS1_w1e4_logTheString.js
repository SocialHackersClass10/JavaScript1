/*
1. Declare a variable `myString` and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
2. Write a `console.log` statement in which you explain in words _what you think_ the value of the string is.
3. Now `console.log` the variable `myString`.
4. Now reassign to the variable `myString` a new string.
5. Just like what you did before write a `console.log` statement that explains in words _what you think_ will be logged to the console.
6. Now console.log `myString` again.*/
