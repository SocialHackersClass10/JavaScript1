/*
1. Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example `items` instead of `item`.
2. Write a `console.log` statement that explains in words _what you think_ the value of the array is.
3. Write a `console.log` statement that logs the array.
4. Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite animals, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.
5. Write a `console.log` statement that logs the second array.
6. Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.
7. Write a `console.log` statement that logs the second array!*/
