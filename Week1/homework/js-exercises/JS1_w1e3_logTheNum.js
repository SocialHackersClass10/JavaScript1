/*Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

1.  First, declare your variable `numberX`. Do not _initialize_ it (which means, don't give it a value) yet.
2.  Add a `console.log` statement that explains in words _what you think_ the value of `x` is, like in this example.
3.  Add a `console.log` statement that logs the value of `numberX`.
4.  Now _initialize_ your variable `numberX` with a number (also called an `integer` in computer science terms).
5.  Next, add a `console.log` statement that explains _what you think_ the value of `numberX` is.
6.  Add a `console.log` statement that logs the value of `numberX`.*/
