1. Create a `for` loop, that iterates from 0 to 20.
2. Create a conditional statement that checks if the value of the counter variable is odd or even.
3. If it's odd, log to the console `The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is odd!`.
4. If it's even, log to the console `The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is even!`.
